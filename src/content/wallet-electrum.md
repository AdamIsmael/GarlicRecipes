# Garlium (Electrum) Wallet
The Electrum wallet is cross-platform, you can install it on Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Windows
Download this [installer](http://f.ske.wtf/garlium/garlium-3.0.3.1-126-gff7ba31-setup.exe) and install it. You should be good to go.  
Thanks to `@Ske#6201` for the Windows Port!

## Mac
Try the Linux installation steps, they should be similar (if not the same).

## Linux
Follow the steps from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Joe0/electrumx-installer).  
Thanks to `@Joe0#8522` for the Linux Port!

## Note
If these don't work or you prefer to use the official wallet (which is a bit harder to use), then follow the other Wallet guides.
